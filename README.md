## Building the website locally

To build to website locally, you will need to install a Ruby development environment. Installation instructions 
for Jekyll under various platforms can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

Once `Jekyll` is installed, follow the given steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Change directory.
3. Run the server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

For any help with the setup, feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/utkarsh2102).
